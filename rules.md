# Introduction

Have you ever wanted to play a tabletop roleplaying game like Dungeons and Dragons or Call of Cthulu? Are the endless pages of rules housed in expensive rulebooks stopping you from trying? Maybe you already play DnD semi-regularly, but someone in your group always flakes last minute. You might even want to convince your non-RPG playing friends to give it a shot, but the buy-in for creating a character is too high. 

5-Minute Adventures is an RPG that looks to solve these problems. The rules are simple, sessions require no prior preparation, and characters can be made in under five minutes. In this booklet are the basic rules required to play, examples of how actual sessions might go, templates for character sheets and adventures, and additional rules for those who want more complexity. Is building a character too much to ask of your group? Then try one of the pre-made adventures with accompanying character sheets at the end of this booklet to get going right now!

All you need to start playing is some paper, these rules (which you will memorize very quickly), and some six-sided dice (the ones that come with boardgames). Enjoy!
# Core Rules

## Who Does What

- There's one Game Master (GM) who narrates a world and creates the adventure
- Everyone else makes characters who will do cool things in this world

If you're going to be the GM, go ahead and skip to the "How to be a GM." For Players, continue below to "How to be a Player."

## How to be a Player

- You get to play make-believe in the GM's fictional world
- You play as a fictional character which could be anything from a fantasy ranger, a superhero, a mutant cat, or even an accountant
- Check-in with the rest of your group to make sure your character isn't too powerful and that it fits in the world you're playing in

### Building a Character

- You can use any piece of scrap paper to build a character, but using an official character sheet will be easiest
- There's character sheets in the back of this booklet, or you can find them online at [adelynflowers.dev/five-minute-adventures](adelynflowers.dev/five-minute-adventures)

Your character has 4 abilities: Skill, Suave, Smarts, and Strength. 

1. Choose one ability to be level 2, the rest start at level 1. On the official character sheet, track levels by filling in the bubbles next to the appropriate category. Write these four abilities and their levels down under "Things I Can Do". 
2. Pick one specific kind of thing your character is good at. Write this thing down under "Things I'm Good At". For a Suave-focused character this might be negotiating, for a Skill-focused character it might be picking locks, for a Smarts-focused character it might be deciphering codes. Think about what kind of obstacles you might encounter during this adventure and choose something that will help you overcome them. 

If you want to build a more complicated character, check out the Optional Rules section for how to add "Times I'm Great In" and something that means everything to you. Examples of how to use these are included in the Play Examples section.

### Rolling Dice

- As you go about playing in this world, your GM might ask you to make a "ability check"
- To make an ability check:
	1. Roll one dice for each level you have in the ability. The GM will tell you which ability to use
	2. Add up all the dice, this is your result
	3. If you're making an ability check for a "Thing I'm Good At", roll the dice again and add them up. You get to use whichever result was higher
	4. Tell your GM your result
- After you roll, note somewhere that you got 1 experience point (XP). Tally marks or collecting physical tokens are good ways to do it
- After you roll an ability and collect XP, you can level it up. It takes 1 XP to go from level 1 to 2, 2 XP to go from level 2 to 3, etc.
- Each 6 that you roll decreases the amount of XP needed. So if you roll one 6 on a level 2 roll, you only need to spend 1 XP to get to level 3

## How to be the GM

Running the game in 5-minute adventures aims to be an easier experience than any other system out there. If you've never GM'd any system before and are not sure how its done, there is a plethora of How-To videos and articles on the internet. Matt Colville is a DnD focused youtube channel but a great place to start. You might also consider watching or listening to TTRPG shows to get a feel for how it goes at a real table. The best way to learn is by doing, however, and this section should help you go from nothing to a prepared adventure in no time.

### Generating an adventure
- There's two ways to generate an adventure: collaboratively or rolling on tables
- You can write down the choices you make on an adventure template included in this booklet or available at [adelynflowers.dev/five-minute-adventures](adelynflowers.dev/five-minute-adventures), or on any sheet of scrap paper
- To generate an adventure collaboratively:
	1. Go around the table and have each player suggest a setting. For examples of settings, check out the "Random Generation" section. Have everyone vote for one setting, the winner will be what you use
	2. Repeat this process to choose a situation and 3 characters
- To generate an adventure by rolling on tables, go to the "Random Generation" section. Roll 2 six-sided dice. The first dice determines which table you use, the second determines which row in that table to use. Use this method to pick a setting, situation, and 3 characters. 
- At this point, explain to the group how to create their characters, and let them build their characters
- Choose 3 milestones for the adventure that represent steps towards the players goal
	- For a heist these might be getting everyone in place, executing the plan, and getting out
- For each milestone, choose something that might get in the players way while they try to achieve it
- Now you're ready to play!

### Running the game
Your job as the GM is to describe a world the players can interact with and have fun inside of. The dangers, characters, and random events you wrote down previously are helpful guide-rails for determining how the adventure progresses. If you're new to running RPGs and not sure how this should work, check out the Play Examples section further on.

As your players interact with the world, they will want to do non-trivial things. An example of a trivial thing is pulling a phone out of your pocket, an example of a non-trivial thing would be breaking down a door. To determine if a character can do something non-trivial, the player does an ability check. To do an ability check:

1. Decide which category this check most closely aligns with: Skill, Suave, Smarts, or Strength. Tell this to the player doing the ability check.
2. Determine the difficulty of the roll. See the difficulty table below to determine what roll is required to pass the check based on the difficulty you chose.
3. Compare the result of the player's roll to the required roll. If the player rolled greater than or equal to the required roll, the ability check succeeds and the player can successfully perform their action. Describe the result of the action's success.

| Difficulty  | Required Roll |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Trivial     | 2             |
| Simple      | 3             |
| Easy        | 6             |
| Manageable  | 9             |
| Challenging | 12            |
| Complex     | 15            |
| Herculean   | 18            |
| Impossible  | 21            |

# Play Examples

## Trouble at the ball

GM: "You're in the most decadent ball room you've ever seen. Gold leaf lines the rims of glasses and designer silks drape over the shoulders of every rich businessman and debutante present. The governor you're assigned to kidnap is at the back of the room, surrounded by private bodyguards with earpieces."

Wren: "I want to try and poison the punch so we can get closer to him in the chaos."

GM: "Awesome! Make a Smarts check. This is an easy task so I'm looking for a 6 or higher. Make me a Suave check as well to hide what you're doing."

Wren: "I have a level 2 in Smarts so I rolled 2 dice and got snake eyes. I'm good at poisoning things so I'm going to re-roll. Okay I rolled 2 dice again and this time it added up to 8! I only roll one dice for Suave and I got a 2."

GM: "You successfully poison the punch but you draw the attention of a nearby wait staff in the process. He's rapidly approaching you with a sour look on his face."

Mike: "Defusing tense situations is one of the times I'm great in, can I intercept?"

GM: "Absolutely! Give me a Suave check. This is manageable so you have to beat a 9."

Mike: "I have level 3 Suave and one additional dice from the time I'm great in. A total of 13!"

GM: "You crush it! What do you say to this worried employee as your friend is dropping chemicals into the punch?"

Mike: "Hey buddy no need to worry, we were hired to provide additional security here. This is a harmless liquid that will only discolor the drink if it's been poisoned. Totally standard stuff."

GM: "He crosses his arms and says 'Well, if you say so. But I got my eye on you!'. Looks like you've managed to poison the punch without too much trouble!"

## Fever pitch

GM: "The skeleton swings its sword at you with the intent to slice off the hand that made such an insolent gesture. Give me either a Skill check to dodge this or a Strength check to shield it. I'm looking for a 6 on either."

Trevor: "I'm going to try and dodge. I have a level 2 skill so I'm going to roll 2 dice. A 2 and 2, not enough. I have 2 XP though, so I'm going to turn those both into 6s and level up my Skill."

GM: "You got it. That won't help you this time but maybe it will save you next time."

Elle: "I'm not only good at protecting but I'm great at protecting my friends in desperate times. Can I jump in between them and throw up my shield?"

GM: "Of course! Go ahead and roll an extra d6 and roll with advantage since you're both good and great at it. I'm looking for Strength of 9 or higher here." 

Elle: "Ok so with a Strength of 3 and the bonuses I'm rolling 4 dice. 15 total on the first roll. Only 8 on the second roll though, so I'll keep the first. 15 total."

GM: "You heroically dash in-between them and throw up your shield. The skeleton's sword weakly clinks off of it and sends it reeling backwards a few steps. Above you, a full moon begins to rise and cast an eerie glow upon the graveyard. Bony arms shoot up from the earth, grasping at the dirt and dragging themselves out of their shallow graves. Their ranks are complimented by none other than a werewolf in at the top of the hill who lets out a ferocious yet pained howl, silhouetted by the light of the moon."

Matt: "I've got this one! I'm a werewolf and protecting my people means everything to me. Can I try and communicate that we're friends and need their help to take out the skeletons?"

GM: "Amazing! You let out a powerful howl that catches their attention. It's been a long time since they've seen one of their own. They're trepidatious about letting intruders onto their turf, but connecting with kin is enough to subdue that conviction for the time being. They let out an affirmative growl and begin slicing down the skeletons on their side of the graveyard."


# Optional Rules

In this section you'll find a number of optional rules. Feel free to apply as many or few of these as you desire to add complexity to your games.

**Increased Character Complexity**
For more complex characters, you can start by adding more things you're good at up to a total of three. You can also add up to two "Times I'm Great In". Times you're great in are a situation plus an action: picking locks in a military complex, telling jokes at a funeral, etc. When you're rolling in a time you're great in, add an extra d6 to the roll. If you are rolling for something you're good at and a time you're great in, the bonuses stack. Finally, you can add one "means everything to me". This is a goal for your character that is separate form the main plot. You can invoke this once per game to do anything you want as long as it furthers your character-specific goal (at the GM's discretion).

**Contests**
If two characters or a character and an NPC are competing with each other to do something, have both parties roll and choose the higher roll.

**Aid**
If one player wants to help another, they must describe how they will help. The player who wishes to provide aid must then make a check that is one level easier than the check they are trying to help with. If they succeed, the difficulty of the check they are helping with is reduced by 2.

**Aid Failure**
When playing with Aid rules, increase the difficulty by 2 if the aid check fails.

**Limiting XP**
For players who are prone to abusing the system, limit XP to the first check in each sequence of checks. If a player is negotiating a deal, for example, only one XP will be awarded for the entire conversation.

**Multi-session Play**
To expand this system to multiple session play, use feats. At the end of each session, each player is awarded a feat based on something they succeeded on in the session. This feat provides some advantage for future play. Reset ability levels in-between each session if they are too close to max.

**Party checks**
For situations where all the players are participating, have each player make a relevant check and take the lowest or highest of the rolls.
