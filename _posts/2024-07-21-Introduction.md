title: Introducing 5-Minute Adventures
---

Welcome to the online home of 5-Minute Adventures! 5-Minute Adventures is a TTRPG I created after playing [Roll for Shoes](https://rollforshoes.com). I felt like there was the potential to make a system that was really easy for new people to pick up and enjoy, while still retaining some uniqueness amongst characters. It's my first RPG and it's not perfect, but it has been a blast to playtest and I truly believe that it's a great way to get new people into the hobby and for surprise gatherings of experienced players.

You can find the rules, character sheets, adventure templates, and other materials using the links on the sidebar. I hope you enjoy it!
